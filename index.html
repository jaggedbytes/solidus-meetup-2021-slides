					<h1><b>About that "E" in E-commerce</b></h1>
					<p>- Jacky Giang</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Hello all and happy Friday! Thank you Sean for coordinating and thank you to you for listening to me meditate on a seemingly trivial subject matter that I imagine everybody in this room is familiar with. However, I feel it’s important for you to act as educators as you help your clients or those with curious minds navigate the world of e-commerce. Modern-day companies are relying on e-commerce to keep their lights on. But they are failing to acknowledge the “E-” in e-commerce, so much so that I simply need to talk about it. More on the format of this presentation, if there are any questions throughout, kindly submit them in the Remo Question tab and I’ll address them at the end. A disclaimer: these are solely my opinions so please exercise critical thinking before assuming them for your own use. Without further ado, let’s get into it!

						Let’s start at the very beginning and ask the question, What is Commerce?

					<p>Generally, it’s the system to allow for the exchange of one thing for another thing...</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						To me, generally speaking, it is the system that allows for the exchange of one thing for another thing. Commerce existed well in the BC days of yore. But, we’re going to find ourselves in the medieval days of yore.

						I recently stumbled upon this luscious Catalan Atlas from the 14th century and we’re going to stay here for awhile. Looking closely, you can see different caricatures and iconography, which I’m inferring as the vivid depictions of all the elements of life and an economy supported by commerce. You’ll also notice that the map is laced with lines, or rightfully the rhumbline network, acting as the modern day equivalent of longitudes and latitudes for navigation. Tracing them, they start and terminate into different nodes presenting a grid system underlying all the elements of commerce.
						<br> <br>
						Picking out a few moments of commerce that stick out to me in particular, (Trade) here we see two people trading or sharing goods of some sort. (Transport) Over here we see a caravan with packed camels going somewhere. (Warehouse) We see two people foraging and gathering food and other valuable resources. (Communicate) We see someone broadcasting a grand message or presenting some kind of gift to their audience. (Finance) We see a rather stoic looking person who appears to be sitting comfortably and surrounded by a nicely organized collection of gold coins in their coffers. I’m sure there’s more depictions of commerce embedded in this map if we stare at it longer. For the sake of this presentation, these are what I’ll call the actors of commerce.

						Expanding on each actor of commerce...
						<br> <br>
						(Trade) This Trading actor manages the exchange of Goods or Services
						- "Double coincidence of wants": a phenomenon brought to you by the 19th century economist, W. S. Jevons: You have something I want and I have something you want. Great, so let’s trade. Let’s consider this scenario: what if you have something I want and I don’t have something you want. No deal, obviously. But, what if I paid you money for it? Alright, now we’re talking. Thanks to globalization, the government printing fiat money and assigning it an arbitrary value to make the economy go round, we have a common language to facilitate trading and relying less on the chance that we both possess something we want from each other.

						You might be wondering, what are some modern day representations of commerce? Well, it can be represented by… Brick and mortar storefronts. This is commerce at one branch of its evolution; from a wide network of actors all condensed into one place, or many places if you’re talking about a retail chain… And, then you might even have HQs for that retail chain only to find out there are parent companies to those HQs… We’ll save that for another time.

						When comparing brick and mortar to e-commerce, brick and mortar relies more on your customer to do a lot of the heavy lifting. For example, they are responsible for finding a way to your store, picking the goods they want to buy, and transporting all of it back home themselves. With e-commerce, the heavy lifting falls actually on the business to figure out. They have to arrange a series of actors that allows the customer that luxurious convenience of shopping with their thumb on their internet-connected smart device.

					<img src="assets/commerce-rhumbline-network-w-lines-2.svg">

					<aside class="notes">
						For example, this is a general order confirmation mapping. As soon as a customer purchases a product from your website (Point A), a transaction is captured and recorded in your payment system (Point B), then the customer is sent a receipt to confirm the completion of their order (Point C). Simple enough right?

					<img src="assets/commerce-rhumbline-network-w-lines-3.svg">

					<aside class="notes">
						Another example that’s a little more complex, the shipment notification. As soon as the order is placed (Point A), a payload is sent to your warehouse (Point B). Your warehouse might be using some middleware that intercepts your payload at Point A’ and translates it to a warehouse-friendly format. Your warehouse then picks and packs the items in the order (Point B) and a payload is sent from your warehouse to your shipping carrier to generate a shipping label to inform Transportation about a new shipment to be delivered to your customer (Point C). Like the warehouse middleware, there could also be a Transportation middleware (Point B’). The warehouse applies the label to the package and moves it to the staging area for transportation to pick up. When transportation picks up the package, a payload is sent back to your store and your customer is informed that their order is headed their way (Point C’).

						Okay, well that was a huge mouthful. What a wonderfully wild game of telephone?! To think this happens to 10 orders per day… okay, that seems manageable. Let’s dial it up to over 1000 orders per day. With a business that’s running open 24/7, how can you be sure that your actors are reliable at every moment? How can you be sure your connections to your actors are consistent and stable when you don’t have control at some points? 
						<br> <br>
						These are all the connections that happen behind the scenes at every click to your analytics platforms, transaction to your payment systems, and payload to your partners and the webhook back. The concert of triggers orchestrated to fire at the right time to the right places stringed together by your developer’s arduous efforts in the grand chase to help streamline and automate the business to be 100% efficient and realize all the cost savings... Yep, this doesn’t happen at all. It’s a wonderfully wild game of telephone with too many actors with some actors relying on other sub actors to close the feedback loop...

With that, let’s add on to the definition of e-commerce.

						Revisiting the values of what makes e-commerce so appealing, there are a couple of attributes that I feel like the average client will breeze right past. In particular, these are the implications from having a hosted application and it being accessible 24/7 on any internet-connected smart device. Rather than having a physical building and paying for electricity, water, and gas. You’ll be paying hosting fees as a result from renting space on some server to house your application as well as the traffic it receives. Sounds like an excellent tradeoff if you ask me!

						If met with disengaged clients as you begin talking about infrastructure, consider it a good time to sit down with your client and really spell it out past the dollar amount. Much like having good plumbing, having a good infrastructure will help with sleeping at night. Help your clients understand that their application and infrastructure are two different things, preferably managed by separate people or even teams.

						While infrastructure wraps it and throws it on the cloud for all those connected to the internet to see. This begs the question of cybersecurity. But, we won’t get into that. Know that firewalls and other controls will absolutely be something that you can explore to enhance the overall protection of your client’s business. Now being on the cloud, infrastructure also allows the application to connect with other applications, such as your client’s partner’s SaaS products. These connections are probably going to be the most powerful utility of the application. It’s the ability to send and receive data to help your client unlock more of their business potential. Remember that your client is running an e-commerce company. They’re probably not large enough to be a logistics company yet. So help them find a partner you both can trust and connect to them through the cloud.

						Past the partners, the app is also ready to connect to the magnificently colorful world of other applications (at a recurring nominal fee of course because they too have to pay hosting fees and have a business to run)! The technology is riddled with too many choices and aggressive marketing. How do we, as tech consultants, help businesses thwart the teeth of marketing from sinking and locking them into unnecessary web services? I’m sure you have all heard about that niche web service that magically solves all of a business’ pain points with a click of a button all while fabricating the onboarding to be cunningly seamless.

						“E-commerce is simple” says the marketer. When all the actors are in synergy with one another, congratulations, the business has achieved the idyllic paradigm of e-commerce and found enlightenment. I will tell you that this simplistic representation is cunningly deceiving. E-commerce marketers have adopted an effectively creative way to repackage e-commerce to appeal to their wider audience. The wider audience in this case are small companies and for the most part e-commerce for them should be simple. Unfortunately, mid-sized companies can fall victim to its simplistic charm.

						The wider audience here is roughly 475,000 companies. How e-commerce is being marketed to be simple makes complete sense. Businesses typically are small and can remain that way without much technological prowess. Business owners should be able to seamlessly onboard to their ecommerce solution so they can resourcefully focus their efforts on product R&D, branding, and merchandising. Through discovery, they can learn more about the e-commerce technology and unlock their greater business potential. A romantic idea, right? Well, at least that’s what I hope for with any business owner in e-commerce. In reality, they want all the things to be done quickly, seem to be afflicted with mad FOMO all the time, and finding themselves changing background colors to increase conversions. But what about those companies who don't fit the standard small business mold?

						Growth comes with problems, such as this data breach. For merchants affected, who do you turn to? Where do you begin to troubleshoot when you don't have access to your infrastructure?
